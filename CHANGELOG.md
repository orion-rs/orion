- Refactoring of streaming contexts used by SHA512, BLAKE2b and Poly1305.

### 0.14.1 [Yanked]

**Date:** May 27, 2019.

**Changelog:**

- Update `zeroize` dependency.

### 0.14.0 [Yanked]

**Date:** May 4, 2019.

**Changelog:**

- [Breaking change] Function `as_bytes()` for public newtypes are replaced with `AsRef<>` trait implementations. This means all `as_bytes()` calls need to be replaced with `as_ref()`.
- [Breaking change] The `SecretKey` for BLAKE2b is longer padded with zeroes to the length of the blocksize. Thus, the `SecretKey` no longer has a `get_original_length()` function, but the same result will be represented by the `get_length()` function instead.
- [Breaking change] All calls to `as_ref()` and `unprotected_as_bytes()` return the newtypes data with what it was initialized, regardless of padding. (With the exception of HMAC)
- [Breaking change] All calls to `get_length()` return the length of the newtype with what is what initialized, regardless of padding. (With the exception of HMAC)
- [Breaking change] All newtypes that offer `generate()` now panic if the RNG fails to initialize of read from its source. This also means that newtype `generate()` functions, that do not take in a size parameter, no longer return a `Result`.
- [Breaking change] `ValidationCryptoError` and `FinalizationCryptoError` have been removed. Though this doesn't mean that there is less information available, see [issue here](https://github.com/brycx/orion/issues/64).
- [Breaking change] Support for cSHAKE256 has been dropped, also meaning orion no longer depends on tiny-keccak. 8% decrease in `unsafe` code in dependencies.
- All fuzzing targets in `fuzz` that used libFuzzer have been deprecated in favor of those in [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/brycx/orion-fuzz) using honggfuzz-rs.
- Improvements to fuzzing targets in orion-fuzz.
- [Automated testing in CI, for constant-time execution](https://github.com/brycx/orion-dudect).
- Added `From<[u8; C]>` trait implementations for C-length fixed-sized newtypes, so that the caller may avoid using `Result` when not working with slices.
- [Breaking change] Module `hazardous::constants` has been removed and all types made private. Only a select number of constants have been re-exported in their respective modules. See [here for more information](https://github.com/brycx/orion/pull/72).
- It is now strictly advised against using orion in debug mode, for what is meant to be production use. Using `opt-level = 0` with orion, is also advised against. See [security section](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki/Security#release-and-codegen-options).
- `rand_os` has been replaced with `getrandom`.
- Improvements to documentation examples as they no longer use `.unwrap()` but `?` instead.

### 0.13.4 [Yanked]

- PBKDF2 and BLAKE2b now panic on lengths exceeding (2^32-1) _ 64 and 2_(2^64-1), respectively.
- ChaCha20 length constrictions are now equivalent to those of the RFC and panics on trying to process more than 2^32-1 keystream blocks.
- Documentation improvements.
- OpenSSL test vectors for BLAKE2b.

**Note**: Strictly speaking, the first two changes are breaking, but because of the unlikeliness that this has an effect on anybody, they were not marked as such.

### 0.13.1 [Yanked]

**Date:** February 16, 2019.

**Changelog:**

**Date:** February 10, 2019.

**Changelog:**

- [Breaking change]: `HLEN` constant renamed to `SHA512_OUTSIZE` and `SHA2_BLOCKSIZE` constant renamed to `SHA512_BLOCKSIZE`.
- Added `POLY1305_OUTSIZE` constant.
- Improved documentation for high-level `Password`, `SecretKey` in `hazardous`s `hmac` and `blake2b`, as well as `Password` in `pbkdf2` of `hazardous`.

### 0.12.4 [Yanked]

**Date:** January 31, 2019.

**Changelog:**

- Fixes a bug where hashing, with BLAKE2b, over 2^64-1 bytes of data would cause an overflowing addition on debug builds.
- Fixes a bug where hashing, with SHA512, over 2^64-1 bytes of data would not result in the counter being correctly incremented.
- Added property-based testing, using QuickCheck, to most of the library and improved testing for the library in general.

**Changelog:**

- [Breaking change]: All high-level functions now return a Result.
- [Breaking change]: `Password` in `pbkdf2`, `SecretKey` and `hmac()` of `hmac` and `extract()` of `hkdf` in `hazardous` now return a Result.
- [Breaking change]: Limit all `generate()` taking a `length` parameter, and `orion::kdf` calls to a length of less than `u32::max_value()` as maximum.
- [Breaking change]: `orion::kdf` and `orion::pwhash` take a new `Password` parameter that is heap-allocated and returns a Result.
- Removed `sha2` dependency and `ring` dev-dependency. `sha2` has been replaced with orion's own SHA512 implementation.
- Added support for BLAKE2b and SHA512.
- Updated to Rust 2018 Edition.
- Better performance for HMAC, HKDF and PBKDF2.

Thanks to Gabe Langlais for valuable feedback, especially on the API design.

**Changelog:**

- Security fix: [#46](https://github.com/brycx/orion/issues/46) ([RUSTSEC-2018-0012](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2018-0012.html), [CVE-2018-20999](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20999)).

### 0.11.0 [Yanked]

**Date:** November 24, 2018.

**Changelog:**

- Fix [missing error propagation](https://github.com/brycx/orion/issues/40) in `v0.10`.

### 0.10.0 [Yanked]

**Date:** November 23, 2018.

**Changelog:**

- New types for secret keys, nonces, tags, etc. This greatly increases misuse-resistance, usability and safety. To read more about the types and how they are implemented, see the [wiki section](https://github.com/brycx/orion/wiki/Design).
- `default` API has been dropped. All high-level functionality is now accessible through these interfaces: `orion::aead`, `orion::auth`, `orion::kdf` and `orion::pwhash`.
- AEAD interfaces in `hazardous` and in the high-level API (previously `default::encrypt`, etc.) have been renamed to `seal` and `open` to reflect the authentication and hopefully increase familiarity.
- `finalize_to_dst()` has been dropped for HMAC.
- Adaption of the `#[must_use]` attribute.
- Documentation improvements.
- HKDF and cSHAKE dropped from high-level API.
- High-level PBKDF2 now uses 64 byte salts and 64 byte password hashes and the iteration count has been made available for users to control.
- Argument `info` for HKDF and `ad` for AEADs are now `Option`.
- `util::gen_rand_key` and `util::compare_ct` are now `util::secure_rand_bytes` and `util::secure_cmp`.
- The password length enforcement in high-level PBKDF2 API has been removed.
- All other public types (eg. `CShake`, `Hmac` and `Poly1305`) now implement `Debug`.
- Using `clear_on_drop` to wipe memory in favor of `seckey`.
- New features `nightly` and `no_std`. To use orion in a `no_std` context, some dependency specifications are needed. Refer to the README for these.
- Major improvements to error propagation.

- Switched out `clear_on_drop` with `seckey`.
- Switched out `constant_time_eq` with `subtle`.
- cSHAKE streaming API.
- `default::pbkdf2` no longer appends salt to password before hashing due to some problems integrating this using `#![no_std]`. This might be re-introduced later on.

Performance improvements compared to v0.4.3:

- HMAC: ~10% performance improvement
