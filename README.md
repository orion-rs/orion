### About
Orion is a cryptography library written in pure Rust. It aims to provide easy and usable crypto while trying to minimize the use of unsafe code. You can read more about Orion in the [wiki](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/wiki).

Currently supports:
* **AEAD**: (X)ChaCha20-Poly1305.
* **Hashing**: BLAKE2b, SHA2, SHA3.
* **KDF**: HKDF, PBKDF2, Argon2i.
* **Key exchange**: X25519.
* **MAC**: HMAC, Poly1305.
* **Stream ciphers**: (X)ChaCha20.

Experimental support (with `experimental` feature enabled):
* **Committing AEAD**: (X)ChaCha20-Poly1305-BLAKE2b.

### Security
This library has **not undergone any third-party security audit**. Usage is at **own risk**.

Orion uses formally verified arithmetic, generated by Fiat Crypto, for the X25519 and Poly1305 implementations. 

See the [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/blob/master/SECURITY.md) regarding recommendations on correct use, reporting security issues and more. Additional information about security regarding Orion is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/wiki/Security).

### Minimum Supported Rust Version
Rust 1.59 or later is supported however, the majority of testing happens with latest stable Rust.

MSRV may be changed at any point and will not be considered a SemVer breaking change.

### Crate Features

- `default`/`safe_api`: All functionality, requires `std`.
- `serde`: Requires either `alloc` or `default`/`safe_api`.
- `alloc`: Argon2i in `hazardous` when `default`/`safe_api` is not available.
- `no_std`: Implicit feature that represents no heap allocations. Enabled by disabling default features and not selecting any additional features.
- `experimental`: These APIs may contain breaking changes in any non SemVer-breaking crate releases.

More detailed explanation of the features in the [wiki](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/wiki/Crate-features).

### Documentation
Can be viewed [here](https://docs.rs/orion) or built with:

```
RUSTDOCFLAGS='--cfg docsrs' cargo +nightly doc --no-deps --all-features
```

### Tests and Fuzzing
The [wiki](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion/wiki/Testing-suite) has details on how Orion is tested. To run all tests:
```
cargo test
```

Fuzzing is done using [honggfuzz-rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs) in [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion-fuzz). See [orion-fuzz](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion-fuzz) on how to start fuzzing Orion.

Constant-time execution tests can be found at [orion-dudect](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion-dudect) and [orion-sidefuzz](https://github.com/orion-rs/orion-sidefuzz).

### Benchmarks
