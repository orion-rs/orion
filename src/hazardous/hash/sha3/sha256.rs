//! # Parameters:
//! - `data`: The data to be hashed.
//!
//! # Errors:
//! An error will be returned if:
//! - [`finalize()`] is called twice without a [`reset()`] in between.
//! - [`update()`] is called after [`finalize()`] without a [`reset()`] in
//!   between.
//!
//! # Panics:
//! A panic will occur if:
//! - More than N __bits__ of data are hashed.
//!
//!
//! # Example:
//! ```rust
//! use orion::hazardous::hash::sha3::sha256;
//!
//! // Using the streaming interface
//! let mut state = Sha256::new();
//! state.update(b"Hello world")?;
//! let hash = state.finalize()?;
//!
//! // Using the one-shot function
//! let hash_one_shot = Sha256::digest(b"Hello world")?;
//!
//! assert_eq!(hash, hash_one_shot);
//! # Ok::<(), orion::errors::UnknownCryptoError>(())
//! ```
//! [`update()`]: sha256::Sha256::update
//! [`reset()`]: sha256::Sha256::reset
//! [`finalize()`]: sha256::Sha256::finalize
